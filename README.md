# PIANIST — Touch Grass 🌿🎹

> **Hear the world. Find the music. Play it.**

An open-source AI music-learning platform that transforms real-world outdoor sounds into piano learning missions, melodic contours, and rhythmic exercises with an extensible AI reasoning architecture and Gemma model bridge.

---

## 🌟 Overview

Most music learning platforms trap students in front of a glass screen:
`Screen → Lesson → Exercise → Screen`

**PIANIST — Touch Grass** reverses the cycle:
```
GO OUTSIDE → LISTEN → DISCOVER → RESPOND → RETURN TO THE PIANO → PLAY
```

The screen is the shortest part of the experience. Learners physically step away from digital devices, explore the outdoors, listen for real rhythms (footsteps, water, traffic, bicycle wheels) and melodic contours (birdcalls, voices, train whistles), and return to the piano to translate environmental sound into musicianship.

## ✨ Core Pillars

1. **The 60-Second Music Walk (Signature Demo)**
   - Guided outdoor mission: *"Put your phone away. Eyes up. Listen."*
   - Active countdown timer with acoustic awareness prompt.
   - Reflection & feature capture upon return.
   - Real-world microphone feature extraction or verified demo datasets.
   - Conversion to an interactive piano exercise.
   - Performance evaluation on the live keyboard.
   - *"You heard it. Now play it. You didn't memorize this. You discovered it."*

2. **AI Reasoning Layer (Local Heuristic & Gemma Cloud Bridge)**
   - Abstraction interface (`AIProvider`) with zero vendor lock-in.
   - **Local Heuristic Provider (Default)**: 100% offline deterministic music reasoning (zero neural weights) with full schema compliance.
   - **Gemma Cloud Provider**: Configurable integration with native hosted Gemma 4 models (`gemma-4-31b-it` / `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`) via the Google GenAI SDK.
   - Generates structured JSON describing sound classification, pulse detection, estimated BPM, melodic contours, and pedagogical exercises.

3. **100% Client-Side Audio Privacy**
   - Live audio is analyzed in-memory via the Web Audio API `AnalyserNode`.
   - Musical features (spectral centroid, RMS energy, onsets) are extracted in real time.
   - **Raw audio buffers are immediately discarded** and never transmitted to external servers without explicit consent.
   - Zero continuous background recording.

4. **Interactive Physical Modeling Piano**
   - Additive synthesis with realistic acoustic overtones, hammer strike transients, and damper pedal decay.
   - Works across touchscreen, mouse, computer keyboard shortcuts (`A-S-D-F-G-H-J-K`), and Web MIDI hardware digital pianos.

5. **Outdoor Missions Library**
   - **Rhythm Hunt**: Capture walking strides, machinery, or rainfall pulses and convert to left-hand bass ostinatos.
   - **Melody Hunt**: Isolate avian and human vocal contours (ascending, descending, arched) and map intervals to treble keys.
   - **Silence Mission**: 60 seconds of silent active listening with post-mission auditory reflection questions.
   - **Sound Map**: Coarse, privacy-safe acoustic mapping (near, mid, far distance) without persistent GPS tracking.
